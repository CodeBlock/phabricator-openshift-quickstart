# An annoying way to deal with config files...
# Phabricator (and libphutil) is a submodule, which is good for two reasons.
# 1) It means every time we push, OpenShift will pull in upstream's changes.
#    (Upstream is very active)
# 2) It forces us to have to work hard to diverge from upstream.
#    And that's exactly what we're doing with our config file -- it's custom.
